# Stm32_GpsData_to_Server
In this study, GPS data was taken with the neo-6m GPS module using Stm32F446re nucleo board and data was sent to the esp8266 board via Uart. This data is sent to the server created with NodeJs, thanks to esp8266. The socketIO library is used for this server-client communication.
